# Quantum Exact String Matching Algorithm

This notebook tutorial provides a practical implementation of an initial Quantum Exact String Matching algorithm, as proposed in our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3660318.3660327) for the [QUASAR 24 Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/quasar24), part of the **ACM HPDC** conference.

## Overview

In our paper, we present the implementation of a quantum ESM algorithm, which identifies occurrences of a specified pattern $x$ of length $m$, within a text $y$ of length $n$ $\geq$ $m$, where both sequences are composed of characters taken from an alphabet $\Sigma$ of size $\sigma$. Our article presents an initial practical implementation of a quantum circuit tailored to address the ESM problem, particularly focusing on **binary strings**.

A classical **na√Øve** approach exhibits a worst-case time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n+m)$, contrasting with the capability of quantum computation to achieve a $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ complexity using **Grover's search**.

We use the **Qiskit** open-source toolkit developed by **IBM**. While current real-world hardware often struggles to produce valid results due to **decoherence** and **quantum errors**, this study presents experimental results from a circuit **simulation** on classical hardware, validating the proposed implementation's efficacy.
